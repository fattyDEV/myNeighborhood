This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

# Getting Started
To get started, open a command prompt, navigate to the project folder and run npm start.

# What to Expect
After the page loads in the browser, you will see a list of different locations in Charlotte, NC. You will also see a map that displays markers for each location. You can also look more into one specific location by clicking on the marker and seeing the address and Yelp rating. Clicking on the location in the side menu will take you to another page with more information and Yelp reviews for that location. The side menu also has a search bar at the top that the user can use to filter through the list of places.

# Project Overview
In this project we were to create a React app from scratch. Within the project we were to us the Google Map API and a third party API to create a list of places, display those places on the map, and access the third party API to display more detailed information about each place.


## Other Resources
This project uses the Google Maps API to create the map, markers, and info windows.

This project uses the Yelp API to display the approved Yelp logos, Yelp star ratings, restaurant images and Yelp reviews. All Yelp logos direct users to the respective restaurant's Yelp page.
